# Create Grio.com ad-landing Page

Assigned with creating a new ad-landing page to attract clients targeted through google ads. I was given a design on zeplin.io and tasked with implementing the site. Utilized Middleman/Contentful/Ruby and Twitter Bootstrap to create the page. Some of the challenges I faced initially was deciding how to format the unorthodox slanted background, combined with layered backgrounds and gradients.Additionally, I had to overwrite how some Bootstrap elements reformatted to meet the requirements of the designer. Later on, I also had to optimize the site for devices under 720px of width.The completed site can be found [here](http://grio.com/web-ux-design-services/).
