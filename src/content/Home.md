# About Me

I’ve recently graduated from UC San Diego (class of 17’) with a degree in Computer Science, and am interning at Grio in San Francisco as a web developer.

During my free time I love to explore new places to eat in the Bay Area. I’m a huge pho and coffee fan, so I’m always interested in trying a new spot!

Current favorite coffee: Philz coffee – Ecstatic (medium medium)

Current favorite pho: Monster pho, Oakland
