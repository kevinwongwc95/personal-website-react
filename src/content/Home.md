# About Me

I've recently completed an internship at Grio as a web developer and am a graduate from UC San Diego with a B.S in Computer Science from UC San Diego.
During my internship I worked on Grio's time-tracking system primarily with Angular/Rails/Mysql and NodeJ.

Post-internship I've been working on learning more React, which can be seen here by my website!
This site is hosted on Heroku and is a React app.

I am seeking full-time software engineering positions. Feel free to email me at <kevinwongwc95@gmail.com> !

During my free time I love to explore new places to eat in the Bay Area. I’m a huge pho and coffee fan, so I’m always interested in trying a new spot!
